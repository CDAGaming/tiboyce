Showing off some new features like display scaling, save states, and turbo mode!

Before you ask, I do plan to release this Soonâ„¢. I hate making estimates, but I think at this point it's safe to say a Spring 2018 release should be doable, if not earlier.

Also, here is the usual reminder that this will only play original Game Boy games (plus colorization) for the first release.
