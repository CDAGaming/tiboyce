It's been a long journey, but we're finally here. The first release!

You can download the release from [GitHub](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/releases).

And thanks to [Adriweb](https://github.com/adriweb), the ROM-to-AppVar converter can be used [directly from your browser]({{ site.baseurl }}/converter)!

I also uploaded a new video with footage from a few games:
